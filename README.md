# BMI-test-selection
The code and benchmarks for the BMI: test selection paper.

In this repository you can find all the code I developed in order to get the results for the paper XXX.
The code is split in the following way:
- MIExp folder: Here is the code for the experiments with succes percentage.
- MIExp2 folder: Here is the code for the experiments with correlation values.
- MIExp3 folder: Here is the code for the experiment to compute execution time.
- MIExp4 folder: Here is the code for the experiments that compare execution times.
- BMIvsTSDm folder: Here is the code for the experiments comparing BMI versus TSDm.
- RealBMI folder: Here is the code for the experiments with real FSMs with succes percentage.
- RealBMI2 folder: Here is the code for the experiments with real FSMs with correlation values.
